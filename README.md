## Mission Statement
  Our mission statement is to provide individuals with enough information so that they can make an informed decision when choosing a healthcare professional.  The health and well-being of all people is very important to our team.  We want to provide a way that the community can share their experiences so that others can make decisions that are the best for them.

## Problem Statement
   It is difficult in the United States to easily find a doctor or specialist, especially one that is both accepted by your insurance provider and comes with a high recommendation by a trusted community.
